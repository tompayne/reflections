When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	-when you want to share your work
	-for safekeeping

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	-you may not want to control which changes to pull, maybe not all of them
	-if you made a mistake locally, you may not want the commit saved
