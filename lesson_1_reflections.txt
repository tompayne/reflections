How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

- It only showed those lines that changed, making it easier to locate what had changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    -You can see your progress, are you getting better?
    -You might be able to reuse something you've done in the past.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    -A pro is that you decide when to make the commit, at a logical point
    -Con, perhaps you forget to manually commit
    -Pro, you do commit anytime

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    -Because one file may be referencing or impacting parts of another file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -git log shows you all the commits
    -git diff compares the changes from one commit to the other

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    -you can alwys go back to a previois version to see where a bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    -creating a project and start using it

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -You can view the log, then use diff to view the changes

Using git log and git diff

As a reminder, running git log will show a list of the recent commits with information about them, including commit IDs. Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits. If you need a refresher, you may want to rewatch this video.

Entering commit IDs

If it is easier, you may enter the first four or more characters of the commit ID rather than pasting the entire ID.
